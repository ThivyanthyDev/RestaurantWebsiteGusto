    <h3><i>Fuchsia Dunlop</i></h3>
    <p>If you’re not sure about Chinese food, you need to get to know Fuchsia Dunlop,
         the foremost expert on the cuisine in the western world. Her writing (if you’re not a cook, head
          first for her memoir Shark’s Fin and Sichuan Pepper) is as tasty as her recipes. Every Grain of Rice sets out to re-educate
         the British palate’s coarse and generalised appreciation for the subtleties of flavour and texture in Chinese food.<br>

    <h3><i>Great British Chefs</i></h3>
    <p>The work of many chefs operating at the top of their game in the UK is showcased here, with interviews,
         features, hundreds of recipes for cooks of all abilities, great ideas for kids and information on seasonal ingredients.
          There are several accompanying apps and a great shop with cookbooks, fine ingredients and cheffy experiences.<br>

    <h3><i>Modernist Cuisine</i></h3>
    <p>Expertise of any kind, particularly the extreme skills on display here, carry costs. The six volumes of the Modernist Cuisine
         cookbooks will set you back £395, however, so you might prefer to get your fix of how science and experimentation intersect
          with cooking on this very professional website.
         The great stories include the science behind mac ’n’ cheese.<br>
