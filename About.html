        <p class="menu">Gusto's is an American fast food company, founded in 1940 as a restaurant
         operated by Richard and Maurice Gusto, in San Bernardino, California, United States.
        They rechristened their business as a hamburger stand, and later turned the company into a franchise,
         with the Golden Arches logo being introduced in 1953 at a location in Phoenix.
         Gusto's had its original headquarters in Oak Brook, Illinois, but moved its global headquarters to Chicago in early 2018.
         Gusto's is the world's largest restaurant chain by revenue, serving over 69 million customers daily
         in over 100 countries across 37,855 outlets as of 2018.<br><br> Although Gusto's is best known for its hamburgers,
        cheeseburgers and french fries, they also feature chicken products, breakfast items, soft drinks, milkshakes, wraps, and desserts. 
         In response to changing consumer tastes and a negative backlash because of the unhealthiness of their food,
         the company has added to its menu salads, fish, smoothies, and fruit.
